# Circle-
The goal of this exercise is to write a class representing the circles.
Write a TestCircle.java program in which you define a class Circle having as private attributes the radius of the circle
(of type double), and the position of its center (the two coordinates in “x” and “y” of type double).
Then declare the public "set" methods for that class, for example:
void setCenter(double x, double y)
void setRadius(double)
double area() which calculates and returns the area of the circle (pi times the square of the radius);
boolean isin(double x, double y) which tests whether the point with coordinates (x,y) passed as a parameter is or is not part of
of the circle (boundary included: closed disc). The method will return true if the test is positive, and false otherwise.
